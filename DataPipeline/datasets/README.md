# Hello World

This sample defines a [shell command activity](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-object-shellcommandactivity.html) to echo the text "hello world". The output, along with
the acitivity log, is saved to an [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

## Parameters

<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>myS3LogsPath</td>
<td>
(Required) An S3 key where the shell output and activity log will be stored. Example: "s3://data-pipeline-samples-12345"
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Setup (Optional)
You can skip this step if you have another S3 bucket that you want to use.

You can use the setup script in the HelloWorld sample directory to create an S3 bucket to use in
this example. The script will take a minute to complete, and when it's finished it will print the resource identifier of the
S3 bucket that it created.

```sh
$> python setup.py
# Creating resources for stack [dpl-samples-hello-world]...
#   AWS::S3::Bucket: dpl-samples-hello-world-s3bucket-<desired id>
```

## Running this sample

Create a new pipeline. Throughout this section we assume that the HelloWorld sample directory is
your current working directory.

```sh
$> aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name hello_world_pipeline --unique-id hello_world_pipeline 
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# {
#     "pipelineId": "desired output"
# }
```

Upload the pipeline definition. Use the `pipelineId` that was returned by the `create-pipeline`
command. Specify the name of an S3 bucket where the output and activity log will be stored. This
will either be the bucket name that was printed by the setup script or another bucket that you've
created.


```sh
$> aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-id <your pipelineId> --pipeline-definition file://helloworld.json --parameter-values myS3LogsPath="s3://<your s3 logging path>"
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# {
#     "validationErrors": [],
#     "validationWarnings": [],
#     "errored": false
# }
```

Activate the pipeline. Use the `pipelineId` that was returned by the `create-pipeline` command.

```sh
$> aws datapipeline activate-pipeline --pipeline-id <your pipelineId>
```

Optionally, check the status of your running pipeline. Use the `pipelineId` that was returned by the
`create-pipeline` command. When the pipeline has completed, the Status Ended column in the output
from this command will show FINISHED for the pipeline nodes. Note that it may take a minute after the
`activate-pipeline` command has completed before the `list-runs` command shows any output.

```sh

>$ aws datapipeline list-runs --pipeline-id <your pipelineId>
#          Name                                                Scheduled Start      Status                 
#          ID                                                  Started              Ended              
#   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#      1.  EC2Resource_HelloWorld                              2020-06-14T16:51:56  RUNNING                
#          @EC2Resource_HelloWorld_2020-06-14T16:51:56         2020-06-14T16:51:59                     
#   
#      2.  ShellCommandActivity_HelloWorld                     2020-06-14T16:51:56  WAITING_FOR_RUNNER     
#          @ShellCommandActivity_HelloWorld_2020-06-14T16:51:  2020-06-14T16:51:59   

```

After the pipeline is completed, the output and activity log from the pipeline will be saved to the S3 bucket that you
specified under the following prefix. To view or download these files, navigate to this prefix in
the S3 section of the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

    s3://<your S3 logging path>/HelloWorld/<your pipelineId>/<pipeline definition>/<pipeline instance>/<pipeline attempt>

## Next steps

Once the pipeline is completed, you can delete it with the following command.

If you try to run the sample again without deleting, you may receive errors or unexpected behavior.

```sh
$> aws datapipeline delete-pipeline --pipeline-id <your pipelineId>
```
The resources used by this example will incur normal charges. If you provisioned resources using the
setup script, you can free them by running the following command in the HelloWorld sample directory.


```sh
$> python setup.py --teardown
# Request to delete stack [dpl-hello-world] has been sent
```
